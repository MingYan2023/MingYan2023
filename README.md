### Hi there 👋  Welcome!

My name is Ming Yan. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Design at Politecnico di Milano.

My core field of research is product and interaction design, focusing on theories of HMI in autonomous vehicles and the nature of design processes, particularly as they pertain to product innovation and creativity. 
Since 2013, my attention has concentrated on the opportunities that smarts and interactive artifacts offer for creating an engaging user experience.
